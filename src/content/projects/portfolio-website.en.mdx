# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies. The site features a clean, responsive design and showcases my projects and skills as a full-stack developer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Internationalization**: Available in English and Spanish
- **Fast Performance**: Built with Astro for optimal loading speeds
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: For static site generation and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **Alpine.js**: For lightweight interactivity
- **MDX**: For content management

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing a robust internationalization system that works seamlessly with Astro's static generation. I solved this by creating dynamic routes and a translation utility that filters content based on the current language.
